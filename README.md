# EcoPark-AIFitnessLevel 🏋️‍♂️💡
## Objective
The EcoPark gym that is being developed can welcome all kinds of customers, from beginners who have never been to a gym before to elite athletes. The energy generated by the machines is used to supply electricity to the gym itself, so it is interesting to know whether a user is able to generate more or less electricity for the gym.

The idea is to create an artificial intelligence capable of predicting whether a user is in good fitness or not, based on their answers to a series of questions (like a questionnaire). This will be helpful to know
if that user is going to be of much help to generate electricity (in the case that he/she is in good physical condition) or, on the contrary, if he/she will not be of many benefits to the gym.

In other words, the goal is to find the ideal client for the gym, so that, as project developers, the team has knowledge of which athletes are most effective for the gym's purpose: to be self-sufficient.
